## **Introduction**
The Favorite and Mute Post feature allows users of our application to personalize their feed by adding posts to their favorites and muting posts they do not want to see. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling them to curate their content according to their preferences.

In addition to the ability to favorite and mute posts, this feature also includes a **Favorite Post Feed**, where users can view all the posts they have marked as favorites.

This README provides a brief overview of how to use this feature and how to contribute to its development.
##
## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
Before implementing the Favorite and Mute Post feature, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Application Environment**: You should have a working environment for your application, including the necessary dependencies and a running backend.
- **User Authentication**: User authentication should be implemented to identify users and allow them to save their preferences.
### **Installation**
- **Update Your Application**: Ensure your application is up to date with the latest codebase.
- **Database Schema**: If your application relies on a database, make sure the schema includes fields for storing user preferences regarding favorite and muted posts.
## **Usage**
### **Adding a Post to Favorites**
To allow users to add a post to their favorites, follow these steps:

- **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface element, such as a button or icon, within the post view, that users can click or tap to add the post to their favorites.
- **Backend Logic**: Implement the backend logic to handle the user's request to add a post to their favorites. This typically involves updating the user's profile or preferences to include the post as a favorite.
- **Feedback**: Provide feedback to the user to confirm that the post has been successfully added to their favorites. This could be a visual indicator or a message of success.
### **Muting a Post**
To allow users to mute a post, follow these steps:

- **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface element, such as a mute button or option, within the post view, that users can click or tap to mute the post.
- **Backend Logic**: Implement the backend logic to handle the user's request to mute the post. This typically involves updating the user's profile or preferences to include the post as muted.
- **Feedback**: Provide feedback to the user to confirm that the post has been successfully muted. This could be a visual indicator or a message of success.
### **Favorite Post Feed**
The **Favorite Post Feed** is a dedicated section of your application where users can view all the posts they have marked as favorites. Here's how to implement it:

- **User Interface**: Create a separate section or tab in your application's navigation or user interface dedicated to the Favorite Post Feed. Users should be able to access this feed easily.
- **Backend Logic**: Implement the backend logic to retrieve and display posts that the user has marked as favorites. This typically involves querying the database for posts that match the user's preferences.
- **User Experience**: Ensure that the Favorite Post Feed provides a pleasant and intuitive user experience. Users should be able to interact with the posts in this feed just like in the main feed.
